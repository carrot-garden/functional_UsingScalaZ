Actually Using ScalaZ
=====================

This project contains the presentation I gave at the Chicago Area Scala Enthusiasts (CASE) meeting on May 21, 2015.

The slides are in slides/index.html. With the presentation open in a browser press the 's' key to open the speaker
view. This will make the speaker notes visible. The speaker notes should provide a pretty good of what I intended to say
about each slide.

I did not use the code in this project as part of the presentation but I did use it test all the code that snipped to
put on the slides.
